	"description": "MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.  The name MapReduce originally referred to the proprietary Google technology, but has since been genericized. MapReduce as a big data processing model is considered dead by many domain experts, as development has moved on to more capable and less disk-oriented mechanisms that incorporate full map and reduce capabilities.",
